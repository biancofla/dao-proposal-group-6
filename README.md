Blockchains are naturally suited to implement decentralized voting systems. However, given the public nature of the blockchain, it is not easy to ensure the anonymity of voting and voters. We want to address these problems by implementing the Open Vote Network protocol. 

The project's objective is to create a DAO with a limited number of participants that allows the creation of surveys and voting operations. Voting operations should be two-rounded and encrypted through the Open Vote Network protocol.

The technical challenge we will face is implementing a DApp that allows users to create polls and vote within them. Also, in implementing the Open Vote Network protocol, we expect to encounter significant technical challenges in implementing non-interactive ZKPs.
